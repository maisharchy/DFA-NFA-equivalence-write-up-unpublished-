# DFA-NFA-equivalence-write-up-unpublished-
I recently became interested in Theory of Computing after studying discrete mathematics, Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms and Theory of Computing at Iowa State and decided to write this paper on my own. I found that I especially enjoy drawing automata, working through equivalence problems, and reasoning about their behavior. This project grew naturally out of that experience, and it reflects how these classes inspired me to explore the equivalence problem more deeply. It is more of an experimental work to express my interest!
