# DFAâ€“NFA Equivalence (Unpublished Write-up)

I recently became interested in **Theory of Computing** after taking the following courses at Iowa State University:
- Discrete Mathematics  
- Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
- Theory of Computing  

Through these classes, I discovered that I especially enjoy drawing automata, working through equivalence problems, and reasoning formally about their behavior.  

This write-up grew out of that experience. It is an **expository paper** on the *equivalence problem* for deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata (DFA vs NFA). The paper surveys classical results, outlines algorithms for DFA equivalence, and discusses why the NFA case is PSPACE-complete.  

The project is not intended as original research, but rather as an **independent exploration** to deepen my understanding of automata and computational complexity.  

*This project reflects my developing interest in automata theory and the boundaries of decidability and complexity.*
